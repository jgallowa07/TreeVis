    '''
    Here ``sample_weight_list`` is a list of lists of weights, each of the same
    length as the samples in the tree sequence ``ts``. This returns an iterator
    over the trees in ``ts`` that is identical to ``ts.trees()`` except that
    each tree ``t`` has the additional method `t.node_weights()` which returns
    an iterator over the "weights" for each node in the tree, in the same order
    as ``t.nodes()``.

    Each node has one weight, computed separately for each set of weights in
    ``sample_weight_list``. Each such weight is defined for a particular list
    of ``sample_weights`` recursively:

    1. First define ``all_weights[ts.samples()[j]] = sample_weights[j]``
        and ``all_weights[k] = 0`` otherwise.
    2. The weight for a node ``j`` with children ``u1, u2, ..., un`` is
        ``node_fun([all_weights[j], weight[u1], ..., weight[un]])``.

    For instance, if ``sample_weights`` is a vector of all ``1``s, and
    ``node_fun`` is ``sum``, then the weight for each node in each tree
    is the number of samples below it, equivalent to ``t.num_samples(j)``.

    To do this, we need to only recurse upwards from the parent of each
    added or removed edge, updating the weights.
